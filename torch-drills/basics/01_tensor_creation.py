DRILL 1: Tensor Creation and Basic Operations

TASK: Create the following tensors and perform basic operations:

1. Create a 3x3 tensor filled with zeros
2. Create a 2x4 tensor filled with ones
3. Create a 1D tensor with values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
4. Create a 2x3 tensor with random values between 0 and 1
5. Create a 3x3 identity matrix
6. Add the zeros tensor and identity matrix together
7. Multiply the ones tensor by 5

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- zeros_tensor: tensor of shape (3, 3) filled with 0.0
- ones_tensor: tensor of shape (2, 4) filled with 1.0
- sequence_tensor: tensor([1., 2., 3., 4., 5.])
- random_tensor: tensor of shape (2, 3) with random values
- identity_tensor: 3x3 identity matrix
- added_tensor: sum of zeros_tensor and identity_tensor
- multiplied_tensor: ones_tensor * 5
