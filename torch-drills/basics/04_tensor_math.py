DRILL 4: Tensor Mathematical Operations

TASK: Perform various mathematical operations on tensors:

1. Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2. Matrix multiplication between two 2D tensors
3. Calculate mean, sum, max, min of a tensor
4. Apply mathematical functions: sin, cos, exp, log
5. Broadcasting: add a 1D tensor to each row of a 2D tensor

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- All operations should work correctly with proper shapes
- Mathematical operations should preserve numerical accuracy
- Broadcasting should work without explicit loops
