DRILL 9: Implementing Loss Functions

TASK: Implement common loss functions from scratch:

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression
2. Binary Cross Entropy for binary classification
3. Cross Entropy for multi-class classification
4. Compare with PyTorch's built-in implementations
5. Test with appropriate sample data

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- All loss functions implemented correctly
- Outputs match PyTorch's implementations within tolerance
- Proper handling of edge cases (like log(0))
