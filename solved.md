# PyTorch Drills - Progress Tracker

## Overview
This project contains 18 PyTorch programming drills designed for intermediate-level programmers. Each drill focuses on different aspects of PyTorch and neural network implementation.

## Environment Setup
- **Virtual Environment**: `torch-env` (created with uv)
- **Activation**: `source torch-env/bin/activate`
- **Dependencies**: torch, torchvision, torchaudio, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas, jupyter

## Progress Summary
- **Total Drills**: 18
- **Completed**: 8
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Not Started**: 10
- **Overall Progress**: 44%

## Grading Scale
- **A+** (95-100%): Excellent implementation, optimal efficiency, great code style
- **A** (90-94%): Very good implementation, minor improvements possible
- **B+** (85-89%): Good implementation, some optimizations needed
- **B** (80-84%): Solid implementation, works correctly
- **C+** (75-79%): Acceptable implementation, has room for improvement
- **C** (70-74%): Basic implementation, meets minimum requirements
- **D** (60-69%): Below average, significant issues
- **F** (<60%): Does not work or major conceptual errors

## Tips for Success
1. **Read the docstrings carefully** - they contain important hints and expected outputs
2. **Test your implementations** - compare with PyTorch's built-in functions when possible
3. **Understand the math** - don't just copy formulas, understand why they work
4. **Debug systematically** - use print statements and tensor shapes to debug
5. **Optimize gradually** - get it working first, then make it efficient

## Next Steps
1. Start with the basics category to build confidence
2. Move through categories systematically
3. Come back to harder drills after building foundational knowledge
4. Update this file as you complete each drill

Good luck with your PyTorch journey! üöÄ
